            <h3>"Behind the Broken Veil"</h3>
        
            <p> When I was behind the veil,<br>
                My life was scared, my dreams Unraveled<br> 
                A champion I was crowned in this world<br> 
                But still a looser in my mind<br>
                When I was behind the veil<br>
                Red flags of uncertainty flied half-mast in my heart<br>
                Recklessly living in the dilemmas of my own pride<br>
                Drowning in between the clashing waves of fear and doubt<br>
            </p>
            <p> When I was behind the veil,<br>
                Sin defined my imperfect identity<br>
                My soul was wrapped in a scarlet like ideology<br>
                Downcast by the depressions of my own fantasy<br>
                When I was behind the veil<br>
                Anger was drafted in the dead pages of my theology<br>
                And my spirit battled my body’s urge of iniquity<br> 
                As I scuffled with the pondering question about God’s reality<br>        
            </p>
            <p> When I was behind the veil<br>
                My mind housed lustful thoughts<br>
                My delcent lips were a den of lies and deceit<br>
                And my hands drafting sexting scripts<br>
                When I was behind the veil<br>
                My past trauma summoned my future pursuit<br>
                Guilt, Condemnation and shame were part of my conviction<br> 
                With the certificate of judgement fully stamped ‘For death Sentence’<br>        
            </p>
            <p> When I was behind the veil,<br>
                I tried breaking forth to the throne of Grace<br>
                Through my good works and keeping codes of belief<br> 
                But the canyon was ever widening in depth of my cold heart<br>
                When I was behind the veil<br> 
                Hopelessly I drove down that rejection lane<br>
                Casting blame throughout my entire mind<br>
                And craving for a fulfillment of my empty heart<br>                
            </p>
            <p> Like a sheep led to the slaughter house<br> 
                My entire life was headed to the devil’s party house<br>
                Regret was the sad piano ballad that along the rhythms of my bruised heart<br>
                And hopelessly it faded in the meditation of my brain<br> 
                As I felt lost and alone me, myself and I<br>                        
            </p>
            <p> I understand you are now beginning to get perplexed<br>
                Wondering how this story might have ended<br>
                Well, right amidst my agony and torment<br>
                Right in the dungeon of sin where even my good actions<br>
                Would only mount as filthy rugs before a holy God<br>
                Christ, the King of kings emptied himself of his Glory<br> 
                Took charge of all my sin’s stated verdict<br> 
                And with his own blood, he signed for redemption<br>                      
            </p>
            <p> On that old ragged cross at the Calvary-Golgotha hill<br> 
                The veil was broken in between, to his presence I was fully invited<br>
                And like a prodigal son he embraced me not willing to listen to my explanations<br>
                He declared I was his very own son, not considering the number of times I had denied him<br>
                You see my sin abound but his Grace abound much, much greater<br>                           
            </p>
            <p> Behold now I stand after the broken veil with my mind renewed<br>
                Totally reprogrammed by the Holy Spirit<br>
                The illusions of fifty shades of were replaced with God’s word of Grace and truth<br>
                I am justified, beloved, favored and highly blessed<br>
                And I do not have to die to be called a saint for this is already part of my own identity<br>
                And if you wanna label me please call me Godson for to him I do belong<br>
                                              
            </p>
            <p> I understand some of my confessions maybe part of your storylines<br>
                Yes, Christ’s sacrifice was for all no matter your status<br>
                Though your sin maybe binding, he will be your vindicator<br>
                If you’re empty, he is whole<br>
                He is a provider and he is love<br>
                Christians are co-heirs with him partakers of his very own nature<br>
                More than conquerors, his very own friends not his slaves<br>
                Trust him to break through your life’s vail<br>
                And you shall surely prevail.<br>
